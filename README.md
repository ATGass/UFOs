# UFOs Analysis
## Overview
The main purpose of this analysis is to be able to filter and make sense of the various groupings that can be made between the date, location, and shape type of UFO sightings. The webpage allows anyone to access the page and explore their curiosity of UFOs.

## Results
The filter can be used by inputting text that aligns with the filter. That means putting a city name in the city filter, the data in the date filter, and so on. Once text is put in the filter box the dataset will change depending on that text box entry. In the example below, we can see how someone might use the shape filter specifically.

### Shape Filter
The shape filter could help explain some sightings if they always happen on certain dates or in certain locations. We can see in the results of a "circle" shape search in the image below.

We can see from the image that there were very similar occurances between the first row and the last row.

## Summary

### Drawback
The largest drawback would be that this data does not take into account natural occurring events in the sky. Meteors come down from the sky, planes cross the night sky, and other aircraft is flown that people might not recognize, all of which could help explain certain events and that cross-reference could help give more clarity.

### Recommendations
The first recommendation I would make would be to have the sightings display as a map. The map would allow you to better see sightings by their geographic location and could make more sense of where sightings happen.
The next recommendation would be to have a place where people can add their own sightings to the database. This would allow the database to stay up to date but it would need to be filtered so that only appropriate inputs were added to the data set.
