# UFOs Analysis
## Overview
The main purpose of this analysis is to be able to filter and make sense of the various groupings that can be made between the date, location, and shape type of UFO sightings. The webpage allows anyone to access the page and explore their curiosity of UFOs.
## Results
### Example 1: Shape Filter
The shape filter could help explain some sightings if they always happen on certain dates or in certain locations.
### Example 2: Location Filter

### Example 3: Date Filter

## Summary
The largest drawback would be that this data does not take into account natural occurring events in the sky. Meteors come down from the sky, planes cross the night sky, and other aircraft is flown that people might not recognize, all of which could help explain certain events and that cross-reference could help give more clarity.
